## 📌 Overview

In this study, we introduce a Panoramic Radiographs dataset **(MD-OPG)** for Pediatric Dental Caries detection and provide benchmarking experiments for both **classification** and **segmentation** tasks.

We evaluate the performance of standard deep learning models using various loss functions, providing a solid baseline for future research.

## 📁 Repository Structure


classification/      # Code for classification task using pretrained ResNet-18 (Keras) + patch extraction code for training this model
segmentation/        # Code for segmentation using UNet and Attention-UNet (Torch) + extracting smile zone images code for these models
figures/             # Supplementary plots (loss and Dice score plots per 3 loss experiments for both segmentation models)
