## üìå Overview

In this study, we introduce a Panoramic Radiographs dataset **(MD-OPG)** for Pediatric Dental Caries detection and provide benchmarking experiments for both **classification** and **segmentation** tasks.

We evaluate the performance of standard deep learning models using various loss functions, providing a solid baseline for future research.
